====================================================================
                    ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!
====================================================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
1. ✅ Medal import error - FIXED
2. ✅ Hardcoded ₹250 in "Pay at Venue" button - FIXED
3. ✅ Venue payment dialog appearing behind registration - FIXED


CHANGES MADE:
-------------
File: src/components/tournaments/TournamentDialog.tsx
  - Added Medal to imports (line 13)

File: src/pages/PublicTournaments.tsx
  - Changed hardcoded ₹250 to use tournament.entry_fee (line 1997)
  - Fixed venue payment dialog z-index to appear on top (lines 2134-2171)
  - Added AlertDialogPortal and AlertDialogOverlay imports


DEPLOY NOW - 2 EASY WAYS:
--------------------------

OPTION 1 - AUTOMATED SCRIPT (EASIEST):
---------------------------------------
Open Terminal and run:

  cd /Users/cave/Downloads/cuephoria-pos
  ./deploy-fixes.sh

The script will automatically:
- Delete node_modules
- Install dependencies
- Build project
- Commit changes
- Push to GitHub
- Vercel will auto-deploy


OPTION 2 - MANUAL STEPS:
-------------------------
1. Delete node_modules folder (use Finder)

2. Run in Terminal:
   cd /Users/cave/Downloads/cuephoria-pos
   npm install
   npm run build
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix entry fee and dialog z-index"
   git push

3. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment

4. Test at: https://admin.cuephoria.in
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R


WHAT TO TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
-------------------------------
✅ No "Medal is not defined" error
✅ Entry fee shows correct amount (not always 250)
✅ Pay at Venue button shows correct fee
✅ Click Pay at Venue - dialog appears ON TOP
✅ All fields are accessible
✅ Can click buttons in venue payment dialog
✅ Apply coupon - discount calculates correctly
✅ Complete registration successfully


WHY IT WILL WORK NOW:
---------------------
- Medal import was missing → Added ✅
- Entry fee was hardcoded → Now uses tournament.entry_fee ✅
- Dialog z-index was 50 → Now 9999 (on top) ✅
- Overlay z-index was 50 → Now 9998 (on top) ✅


IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
1. You MUST delete node_modules before npm install
2. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Do a HARD REFRESH in browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Set custom entry fee when creating tournaments


QUESTIONS?
----------
If anything doesn't work:
1. Check Vercel deployment status
2. Make sure you did a hard refresh
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Make sure tournament has entry_fee set in admin
